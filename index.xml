      <description>CozyKeys.xyz is Live! Thursday, Sep 6, 2018  I had a few weeks in which I was waiting for the supplies to arrive in the mail for the rev2 Bloomer keyboards. In this time, I decided to rethink how I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my content.
In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve written blog posts on a personal website, posted build logs to Imgur and GitHub gists, shared photos on Reddit, and recently started posting updates on Keebtalk.</description>

      <description>First Handwired Bloomer This keyboard was previously named the Atreus87/Ergo87
Previewing the Layout Before building the keyboard, I put some switches and keycaps on it to make sure the layout is comfortable.
 Here&amp;rsquo;s another angle showing the thumb key profiles.
 I chose to go with GMK Iris as it has R0 and R5 profiles in the top and bottom row. My hope was that this would help the the function keys stand out a bit from the number keys, and it does.</description>

      <description>Bloomer Former names: Atreus87, Ergo87
The Bloomer is an 87-key ergonomic keyboard, inspired by the Atreus and Atreus62. There are a few main goals behind the keyboard listed below.
 
Easier Adaptation The first goal of the Bloomer is to provide an ergonomic option that is less intimidating to those who are considering an ergonomic layout. Many of the ergonomic or ortholinear options currently available are not easy to adapt to.</description>

      <description>Speedo The Speedo is a 66-key ergonomic keyboard. It is heavily inspired by the Atreus and Atreus62 but introduces a few improvements.
 Thumb Clusters One of the most common complaints about the Atreus(62) is the location of the inner-most thumb keys. The Speedo takes the two inner-most thumb keys from each side and places them in a curved arc, making them easier to press via a natural thumb movement.</description>

      <description>Atreus62 Review Saturday, Dec 16, 2017  
Here is my review of the Atreus62 keyboard after using it as a daily driver for 6 weeks.
  
Technical details  Gateron red switches Cherry Profile PBT keycaps (EnjoyPBT &amp;amp; Gateron blanks)  Pros  The layout is very comfortable for the most part  I love columnar stagger and having multiple keys to press with my thumbs Only two keys are uncomfortable to press  Great for gaming  The left hand can comfortably rest on WASD Easy to play games with very little to no remapping  Compact  Previous ergonomic keyboards I used such as the Kinesis Advantage are big and hard to travel with Similar size to a standard 60% Practical to throw in a backpack Easy to have a sleeve made  QMK firmware  Fully programmable One of my biggest complaints about the Kinesis is that is runs proprietary fimware and I was too lazy to replace the PCB with a stapleton and teensy I can choose what to put on the top layer and put other keys such as arrows and curly braces on lower layers  Nice sound and aesthetic  The size and hallowness of the advantage makes it sound bad, even after I installed some dampening foam on the inside This board sounds and doesn&amp;rsquo;t look as crazy   Cons  Inner-most thumb keys  The two 1.</description>

 Background A few years ago I bought my first mechanical keyboard; it was a Coolermaster CM Storm with cherry MX blue switches and I instantly loved it.</description>
