      <description>Bloomer Former names: Atreus87, Ergo87
The Bloomer is an 87-key ergonomic keyboard, inspired by the Atreus and Atreus62. There are a few main goals behind the keyboard listed below.
 
Easier Adaptation The first goal of the Bloomer is to provide an ergonomic option that is less intimidating to those who are considering an ergonomic layout. Many of the ergonomic or ortholinear options currently available are not easy to adapt to.</description>

      <description>Speedo The Speedo is a 66-key ergonomic keyboard. It is heavily inspired by the Atreus and Atreus62 but introduces a few improvements.
 Thumb Clusters One of the most common complaints about the Atreus(62) is the location of the inner-most thumb keys. The Speedo takes the two inner-most thumb keys from each side and places them in a curved arc, making them easier to press via a natural thumb movement.</description>
